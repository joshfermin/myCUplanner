### Project Info:
------
For our project we were able to get everything to work except for the prerequisites. We were unable to find a pre-existing database that contains every class and their corresponding prerequisite, hence we did not think it would be an efficient use of our time to input the data manually. 

### Project Additions:
------
Yet, we were able to add a User profile page which shows their courses taken and then their courses for next semester. Not only that, we added a schedule page that shows a current user's events and all their classes. These were two additions that brings the view total over 5. Furthermore, we were able to implement an "add event" functionality to the calendar so that the users can schedule things around their classes.
